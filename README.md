# Denis's and Ivans Race00

## This repository contains two compiled programs functions implementations to which I had to write together with my mate in *C* during the ucode Marathon in Race00 and the source code to them.

**Cube** — asks the user to enter the size, and displays **the cube** of that size.
*Note: The size has to be greater than **1,** otherwise the program will display **nothing**.*

**Pyramid** — asks the user to enter the size, and displays the pyramid of that size.
*Note: Pyramid size has to be even and larger than **1,** otherwise the program will display nothing.*

#### To run **CLI programs** on **Linux** or **MacOS** you have to open the terminal in the directory where they are contained and type:
```./<name-of-the-program>```

The purpose of this repo is utterly to share it with others.
